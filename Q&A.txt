Git Q&A:

Q:
HEAD detached at Testing/Develop

A:
because git init moved HEAD to direct commit of Develop branch
Fixed: 1. adding new branch is automatically moved HEAD
2. moving HEAD manually
git commit -m "..."  << understand where is HEAD
git checkout master
git cherry-pick <hash_of_commit_with HEAD>
